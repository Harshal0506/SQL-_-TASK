Hi All,

Before you move onto the next lecture, please remember that order is important when dealing with combining/wrapping certain string functions.

For example:

This works:

SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname)) AS "full name in caps"
FROM books;
While this does not:

SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(author_fname, ' ', author_lname)) AS "full name in caps" 
FROM books;
UPPER only takes one argument and CONCAT takes two or more arguments, so they can't be switched in that way.

You could do it this way, however:

SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(author_fname), ' ', UPPER(author_lname)) AS "full name in caps" 
FROM books;
But, the first example above would be better (more DRY*) because you wouldn't need to call UPPER two times.

*Don't Repeat Yourself
