**  faker.date.past();  ka format is not yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss what our sql is looking for


Try inserting one row with date in format faker give us in sql  ----> it will  set time as 00:00:00 and date as 0000-00-00

now when we insert the same data using node 

connection.query('insert into users set ?',person,function......

its get inserted  with the correct value

underneath its the code mysql package that convert our stuff
Its the great magic of mysql node package
