Documentation for the MySQL Node Package: 

Step 1: Install the MySQL Node Package
npm install mysql 



Step 2: Connect to Database*
var mysql = require('mysql');

var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'learnwithcolt',  //your username
  database : 'join_us'         //the name of your db
});


Step 3: Run Queries
Running a super simple SQL query like:

SELECT 1 + 1; 

Using the MySQL Node Package:

connection.query('SELECT 1 + 1 AS solution', function (error, results, fields) {
   if (error) throw error;
   console.log('The solution is: ', results[0].solution);
});


Another sample query, this time selecting 3 things:

var q = 'SELECT CURTIME() as time, CURDATE() as date, NOW() as now';
connection.query(q, function (error, results, fields) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(results[0].time);
  console.log(results[0].date);
  console.log(results[0].now);
});
The equivalent SQL query:

SELECT CURTIME() as time, CURDATE() as date, NOW() as now;



end the connection 

connection.end();   //close the connection note the change in cursor with and without it



*Note:
We don't recommend using AWS, but if you are using the AWS version of Cloud9 then you'll need to include a password for the user, see example below:

var mysql = require('mysql');
 
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'root',  //your root username (leave as root)
  database : 'join_us',   //the name of your db (create this if you haven't already)
  password : process.env.MYSQL_PW   //your root user's password
});
In order for this to work you'll first need to export the root password in an environment variable.
Run the following command from your bash terminal:

export MYSQL_PW='your-password-here'
